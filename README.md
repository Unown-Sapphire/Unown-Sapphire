Hello. My username is UnoSapphire!
I am 17 and a coding fanatic.
Most of my repositories are private, and the ones that I want people to see and access are my slightly bigger projects
So far, I only have experience with Discord Bots made with Python and a little dabbling with APIs and AI models, and using these completely self-taught concepts, I wish to apply this knowledge to more sophisticated projects.

Unown-Sapphire/Unown-Sapphire is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
