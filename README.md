Hello. My username is UnoSapphire, for private reasons I am not allowed to give out my real name.
I am learning to code slowly, as I am only 15 I want to have a headstart from other people when I get into college.
Most of my repositories will be private, and the ones which I want the people to see and access are my slightly bigger projects
So far I only have experience with Discord Bots made with Python, and using these concepts that were completely self taught I wish to apply this type of knowlege
into more sophisticated projects.

Unown-Sapphire/Unown-Sapphire is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
